## 🚀 Elite Features

### 1. 🧠 Autonomous Strategic Orchestrator
Unlike traditional search tools, this agent uses a **Multi-Wave Strategic Brain** to plan its discovery process.
- **Wave-based Planning**: The AI plans up to 100 waves of search, adjusting keywords and platforms based on previous results.
- **Creative Directions**: It explores synonyms and related roles (e.g., "Vibe Coder", "AI Architect") to find hidden gems.
- **Self-Correction**: If a wave yields no results, the AI pivots its strategy automatically.

### 2. 🌍 Global Deep Career Scraper
Go beyond overcrowded job boards. Our **Deep Discovery Engine** finds jobs where they are born:
- **Domain Discovery**: Automatically identifies company websites matching your niche.
- **Career Page Detection**: Intelligently finds "Join Us" or "Careers" links on any domain.
- **Agentic Extraction**: Uses AI to "read" the career page HTML and extract listings, regardless of the site's layout or language.

### 3. 🧠 Instinct System (Personalized Learning)
The agent grows smarter with every interaction.
- **Historical Analysis**: Every time you save or delete a job, the agent records an **Instinct**.
- **Refined Matching**: These instincts are fed back into the AI's matching logic to ensure your recommendations evolve toward your perfect fit.

### 4. 🛡️ Automated Quality Guardrails
Never see a "junk" job again.
- **The Job Auditor**: Every listing undergoes an automated audit for broken links, thin descriptions, and suspicious content before it enters your dashboard.

## 🛠️ How it was Made (Tech & Architecture)

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) with a premium, glassmorphic UI.
- **AI Brain**: Google **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for high-speed, high-reasoning strategic planning and job matching.
- **Scraping**: A hybrid engine combining **Puppeteer** (for deep web scraping) and 10+ REST/RSS APIs (Remotive, RemoteOK, etc.).
- **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions and API Routes with SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time progress streaming.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** for persistent storage of jobs, resume profiles, and learned instincts.

### The Agentic Workflow
1. **Plan**: AI analyzes your profile and generates a multi-task search strategy.
2. **Execute**: The Orchestrator runs scraper tasks in parallel across Google Search and job boards.
3. **Deep Scrape**: Puppeteer navigates found company websites to extract direct listings.
4. **Audit**: The Auditor filters out low-quality results.
5. **Match**: The Matcher scores results based on your Resume + Learned Instincts.
6. **Learn**: Your feedback updates the Instinct Store, closing the loop.
